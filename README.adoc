A template application to showcase features from link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js-sdk[Aerogear Js SDK].

As this application showcases features from link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js-sdk[Aerogear Js SDK] ensure you checkout the desired git tag for whatever SDK version you intend to run. Check link:https://www.npmjs.com/org/aerogear[NPM] for associated versions and releases.

== Features
* link:https://docs.aerogear.org/aerogear/latest/identity-management.html[AeroGear Identity Management Service]
* link:https://docs.aerogear.org/aerogear/latest/device-security.html[Device Security Checks]
* link:https://docs.aerogear.org/aerogear/latest/mobile-metrics.html[Mobile Metrics]
* link:https://docs.aerogear.org/aerogear/latest/push-notifications.html[Push Notifications]

== Pre-requisites
To run this application, the following is required (depending on which platform you wish to run the application on):

* link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node] - version 8.9.4
* link:https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode]
* link:https://developer.android.com/studio/install[Android Studio]
* link:https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/sdk-tools[Android SDK Tools]

== Build Instructions

=== Cloning the application

```
git clone git@github.com:aerogear/cordova-showcase-template.git && cd cordova-showcase-template
```

=== Running the App
This application can be run as a showcase using a published version of the AeroGear Js SDK, or as a development aid to working on the SDK.

==== Run Showcase
The `master` branch will always track to the latest release of the SDK.

To build the showcase app, run:
```
npm install
npm run ionic:build
```
You can choose to run the application on android or ios.
```
npm run ionic:android // to run in an android

npm run ionic:ios // to run in an ios
```

==== Troubleshooting

===== Working with iOS and Android together
When running the application on both android or ios you will need to clean the projects root directory to remove conflicting files specific to each platform
This can be done by running the following:
```
npm run clean
```

===== iOS Pod linking Issue
If after running the application for iOS you get the following error: 
```
ld: library not found for -lGoogleToolboxForMac
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

run the following command from the root of the directory:
```
cd platforms/ios && pod install
```

and then re build the application.

===== Work with Self-signed Certificate

To use self-signed certificates, see the guide here: link:https://docs.aerogear.org/aerogear/latest/getting-started.html#using-self-signed-certificates-in-mobile-apps[]

Note, if using Android API Level 24 or newer, you must tell the application to trust user certificates by using a file 
such as link:https://github.com/aerogear/cordova-showcase-template/blob/master/network_security_config.xml[this one] and including it in the android platform like this in the config.xml:

```
<resource-file src="network_security_config.xml" target="app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml" />
<edit-config file="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" mode="merge" target="/manifest/application">
    <application android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" />
</edit-config>
```
